self.Kp_linear = 1.0   # Proportional gain for linear velocity
self.Kd_linear = 0.1   # Derivative gain for linear velocity
self.Kp_angular = 1.0  # Proportional gain for angular velocity
self.Kd_angular = 0.1  # Derivative gain for angular velocity




ros2 launch first_order_boustrophedon_navigator boustrophedon.launch.py
```

3. Monitor performance:
```bash
# View cross-track error as a number
ros2 topic echo /cross_track_error

# Or view detailed statistics in the launch terminal
```

4. Visualize trajectory and performance:
```bash
ros2 run rqt_plot rqt_plot
```
Add these topics:
- /turtle1/pose/x
- /turtle1/pose/y
- /turtle1/cmd_vel/linear/x
- /turtle1/cmd_vel/angular/z
- /cross_track_error

## Evaluation Criteria

1. Controller Performance (60%)
   - Average cross-track error < 0.2 units (25%)
   - Maximum cross-track error < 0.5 units (15%)
   - Smooth velocity profiles (10%)
   - Clean cornering behavior (10%)

2. Pattern Quality (20%)
   - Even spacing between lines
   - Complete coverage of target area
   - Efficient use of space

3. Documentation (20%)
   - Clear explanation of tuning process
   - Well-presented performance metrics
   - Thoughtful analysis of results

## Submission Requirements

1. GitHub Repository:
   - Commit messages should be descriptive

2. Documentation in Repository:
   - Update the README.md in your fork with:
     - Final parameter values with justification
     - Performance metrics and analysis
     - Plots showing:
       - Cross-track error over time
       - Trajectory plot
       - Velocity profiles
     - Discussion of tuning methodology
     - Challenges and solutions

3. Submit your work:
   - Submit the URL of your GitHub repository
   - Ensure your repository is public
   - Final commit should be before the deadline

## Tips for Success
- Start with low gains and increase gradually
- Test one parameter at a time
- Pay attention to both straight-line tracking and cornering
- Use rqt_plot to visualize performance in real-time
- Consider the trade-off between speed and accuracy

## Grading Rubric
- Perfect tracking (cross-track error < 0.2 units): 100%
- Good tracking (cross-track error < 0.5 units): 90%
- Acceptable tracking (cross-track error < 0.8 units): 80%
- Poor tracking (cross-track error > 0.8 units): 60% or lower

Note: Final grade will also consider documentation quality and analysis depth.

## Extra Credit (10 points)
Create and implement a custom ROS2 message type to publish detailed performance metrics:
- Define a custom message type with fields for:
  - Cross-track error
  - Current velocity
  - Distance to next waypoint
  - Completion percentage
  - Other relevant metrics
- Implement the message publisher in your node
- Document the message structure and usage

This will demonstrate understanding of:
- ROS2 message definitions
- Custom interface creation
- Message publishing patterns
