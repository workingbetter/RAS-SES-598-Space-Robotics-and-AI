oring and precision farming
  - Search and rescue operations
  - Environmental mapping and monitoring
  - Geological or archaeological surveys
  
- **Ocean Exploration**: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) use boustrophedon patterns to:
  - Map the ocean floor
  - Search for shipwrecks or aircraft debris
  - Monitor marine ecosystems
  
The efficiency and accuracy of these surveys depend heavily on the robot's ability to follow the prescribed path with minimal deviation (cross-track error). This assignment simulates these real-world challenges in a 2D environment using a first-order dynamical system (the turtlesim robot).

## Objective
Tune a PD controller to make a first-order system execute the most precise boustrophedon pattern possible. The goal is to minimize the cross-track error while maintaining smooth motion.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding PD control parameters and their effects on first-order systems
- Practical experience with controller tuning
- Analysis of trajectory tracking performance
- ROS2 visualization and debugging

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
Choose one of the following combinations:
- Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS2 Humble
- Ubuntu 23.04 + ROS2 Iron
- Ubuntu 23.10 + ROS2 Iron
- Ubuntu 24.04 + ROS2 Jazzy

### Required Packages
```bash
sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-turtlesim
sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-rqt*
```

### Python Dependencies
```bash
pip3 install numpy matplotlib
```

## The Challenge

### 1. Controller Tuning (60 points)
Use rqt_reconfigure to tune the following PD controller parameters in real-time:
```python
# Controller parameters to tune
self.Kp_linear = 1.0   # Proportional gain for linear velocity
self.Kd_linear = 0.1   # Derivative gain for linear velocity
self.Kp_angular = 1.0  # Proportional gain for angular velocity
self.Kd_angular = 0.1  # Derivative gain for angular velocity
```

Performance Metrics:
- Average cross-track error (25 points)
- Maximum cross-track error (15 points)
- Smoothness of motion (10 points)
- Cornering performance (10 points)

### 2. Pattern Parameters (20 points)
Optimize the boustrophedon pattern parameters:
```python
# Pattern parameters to tune
self.spacing = 1.0     # Spacing between lines
```
- Coverage efficiency (10 points)
- Pattern completeness (10 points)

### 3. Analysis and Documentation (20 points)
Provide a detailed analysis of your tuning process:
- Methodology used for tuning
- Performance plots and metrics
- Challenges encountered and solutions
- Comparison of different parameter sets

## Getting Started

### Repository Setup
1. Fork the course repository:
   - Visit: https://github.com/DREAMS-lab/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI
   - Click "Fork" in the top-right corner
   - Select your GitHub account as the destination

2. Clone your fork (outside of ros2_ws):
```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI.git
```

3. Create a symlink to the assignment in your ROS2 workspace:
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
ln -s ~/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI/assignments/first_order_boustrophedon_navigator .
```

### Building and Running
1. Build the package:
```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select first_order_boustrophedon_navigator
source install/setup.bash
```

2. Launch the demo:
```bash
ros2 launch first_order_boustrophedon_navigator boustrophedon.launch.py
```

3. Monitor performance:
```bash
# View cross-track error as a number
ros2 topic echo /cross_track_error

# Or view detailed statistics in the launch terminal
```

4. Visualize trajectory and performance:
```bash
ros2 run rqt_plot rqt_plot
```
Add these topics:
- /turtle1/pose/x
- /turtle1/pose/y
- /turtle1/cmd_vel/linear/x
- /turtle1/cmd_vel/angular/z
- /cross_track_error

## Evaluation Criteria

1. Controller Performance (60%)
   - Average cross-track error < 0.2 units (25%)
   - Maximum cross-track error < 0.5 units (15%)
   - Smooth velocity profiles (10%)
   - Clean cornering behavior (10%)

2. Pattern Quality (20%)
   - Even spacing between lines
   - Complete coverage of target area
   - Efficient use of space

3. Documentation (20%)
   - Clear explanation of tuning process
   - Well-presented performance metrics
   - Thoughtful analysis of results

## Submission Requirements

1. GitHub Repository:
   - Commit messages should be descriptive

2. Documentation in Repository:
   - Update the README.md in your fork with:
     - Final parameter values with justification
     - Performance metrics and analysis
     - Plots showing:
       - Cross-track error over time
       - Trajectory plot
       - Velocity profiles
     - Discussion of tuning methodology
     - Challenges and solutions

3. Submit your work:
   - Submit the URL of your GitHub repository
   - Ensure your repository is public
   - Final commit should be before the deadline

## Tips for Success
- Start with low gains and increase gradually
- Test one parameter at a time
- Pay attention to both straight-line tracking and cornering
- Use rqt_plot to visualize performance in real-time
- Consider the trade-off between speed and accuracy

## Grading Rubric
- Perfect tracking (cross-track error < 0.2 units): 100%
- Good tracking (cross-track error < 0.5 units): 90%
- Acceptable tracking (cross-track error < 0.8 units): 80%
- Poor tracking (cross-track error > 0.8 units): 60% or lower

Note: Final grade will also consider documentation quality and analysis depth.

## Extra Credit (10 points)
Create and implement a custom ROS2 message type to publish detailed performance metrics:
- Define a custom message type with fields for:
  - Cross-track error
  - Current velocity
  - Distance to next waypoint
  - Completion percentage
  - Other relevant metrics
- Implement the message publisher in your node
- Document the message structure and usage

This will demonstrate understanding of:
- ROS2 message definitions
- Custom interface creation
- Message publishing patterns
