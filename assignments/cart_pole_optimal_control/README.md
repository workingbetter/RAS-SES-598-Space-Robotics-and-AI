## Assignment Objectives

### Core Requirements
1. Analyze and tune the provided LQR controller to:
   - Maintain the pendulum in an upright position
   - Keep the cart within its ±2.5m physical limits
   - Achieve stable operation under earthquake disturbances
2. Document your LQR tuning approach:
   - Analysis of the existing Q and R matrices
   - Justification for any tuning changes made
   - Analysis of performance trade-offs
   - Experimental results and observations
3. Analyze system performance:
   - Duration of stable operation
   - Maximum cart displacement
   - Pendulum angle deviation
   - Control effort analysis

### Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of LQR control parameters and their effects
- Experience with competing control objectives
- Analysis of system behavior under disturbances
- Practical experience with ROS2 and Gazebo simulation

### Extra Credit Options
Students can implement reinforcement learning for extra credit (up to 30 points):

1. Reinforcement Learning Implementation:
   - Implement a basic DQN (Deep Q-Network) controller
   - Train the agent to stabilize the pendulum
   - Compare performance with the LQR controller
   - Document training process and results
   - Create training progress visualizations
   - Analyze and compare performance with LQR

## Implementation

### Controller Description
The package includes a complete LQR controller implementation (`lqr_controller.py`) with the following features:
- State feedback control
- Configurable Q and R matrices
- Real-time force command generation
- State estimation and processing

Current default parameters:
```python
# State cost matrix Q (default values)
Q = np.diag([1.0, 1.0, 10.0, 10.0])  # [x, x_dot, theta, theta_dot]

# Control cost R (default value)
R = np.array([[0.1]])  # Control effort cost
```

### Earthquake Disturbance
The earthquake generator (`earthquake_force_generator.py`) provides realistic disturbances:
- Configurable through ROS2 parameters
- Default settings:
  ```python
  parameters=[{
      'base_amplitude': 15.0,    # Strong force amplitude (N)
      'frequency_range': [0.5, 4.0],  # Wide frequency range (Hz)
      'update_rate': 50.0  # Update rate (Hz)
  }]
  ```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- ROS2 Humble or Jazzy
- Gazebo Garden
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages: numpy, scipy

#### Installation Commands
```bash
# Set ROS_DISTRO as per your configuration
export ROS_DISTRO=humble

# Install ROS2 packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
    ros-$ROS_DISTRO-ros-gz-bridge \
    ros-$ROS_DISTRO-ros-gz-sim \
    ros-$ROS_DISTRO-ros-gz-interfaces \
    ros-$ROS_DISTRO-robot-state-publisher \

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install numpy scipy control
```

### Repository Setup

#### If you already have a fork of the course repository:
```bash
# Navigate to your local copy of the repository
cd ~/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI

# Add the original repository as upstream (if not already done)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/DREAMS-lab/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI.git

# Fetch the latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Checkout your main branch
git checkout main

# Merge upstream changes
git merge upstream/main

# Push the updates to your fork
git push origin main
```

#### If you don't have a fork yet:
1. Fork the course repository:
   - Visit: https://github.com/DREAMS-lab/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI
   - Click "Fork" in the top-right corner
   - Select your GitHub account as the destination

2. Clone your fork:
```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI.git
```

### Create Symlink to ROS2 Workspace
```bash
# Create symlink in your ROS2 workspace
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
ln -s ~/RAS-SES-598-Space-Robotics-and-AI/assignments/cart_pole_optimal_control .
```

### Building and Running
```bash
# Build the package
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --packages-select cart_pole_optimal_control --symlink-install

# Source the workspace
source install/setup.bash

# Launch the simulation with visualization
ros2 launch cart_pole_optimal_control cart_pole_rviz.launch.py
```

This will start:
- Gazebo simulation (headless mode)
- RViz visualization showing:
  * Cart-pole system
  * Force arrows (control and disturbance forces)
  * TF frames for system state
- LQR controller
- Earthquake force generator
- Force visualizer

### Visualization Features
The RViz view provides a side perspective of the cart-pole system with:

#### Force Arrows
Two types of forces are visualized:
1. Control Forces (at cart level):
   - Red arrows: Positive control force (right)
   - Blue arrows: Negative control force (left)

2. Earthquake Disturbances (above cart):
   - Orange arrows: Positive disturbance (right)
   - Purple arrows: Negative disturbance (left)

Arrow lengths are proportional to force magnitudes.
